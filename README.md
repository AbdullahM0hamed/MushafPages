# What is this

Pages of the mushaf in html that I plan to use in an upcoming project. The pages werre generated using the `mushafpages.py` python script (the script takes a file and a dir name as arguments). The zip files on which the script was run can be found [here](https://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/ten-readings/)
